# UI test automation of Alza webpage
Basic automated UI tests of Alza webpage built on Python, Selenium WebDriver and pytest, using page object model. Tests are run in Chrome and Firefox browsers, include mixed assertions (soft by default, each can be set as hard) and html report (logging steps, failures, capturing screenshots and recording URL in case of failure, located under "Tests\Reports"). Code is stored in „Python_Selenium“ folder.\
Following steps describe actions needed to run tests in PyCharm on Windows operating system. The steps are mostly described briefly so they don't cover all possible issues though some specific actions are described in more detail.

- Click hamburger menu in top left corner, go to „File“ – „Settings“ – „Tools“ – „Python Integrated Tools“:
   - In field „Package requirements file“ select „requirements.txt“ file that is in „Alza-Selenium-Python\Python_Selenium\Config“.
   - In field „Default test runner“ select „pytest“.
   - Click „Apply“ button and close window by „OK“ button.
- In project navigator go to „Python_Selenium\Tests“ and open file „tests_Alza.py“. Once file is opened, at the top of the screen there is shown message saying that package requirements are not satisfied. In the message click „Install requirements“, in displayed window leave all packages ticked, click „Install“ button and wait for the packages to get installed.

## Test execution
- In PyCharm in project navigator open file „tests_Alza.py“ that is in „Python_Selenium\Tests“.
