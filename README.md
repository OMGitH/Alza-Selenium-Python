# Alza
Basic automated UI tests of Alza webpage that use Python, Selenium and pytest. UI tests are created based on 5 example test cases that are in this repository as well together with example bug report. UI tests can be found in folder „Python_selenium“, example test cases with bug report in folder „Test_cases_Bug_report“.
Following are steps describing actions needed to run tests on Windows operating system. Mostly they are described briefly so they don't cover all possible issues though some specific actions are described in more detail.

## Python installation
- Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/.

- In window „User variables for <user name>“ select „Path“ and click „Edit…“.
- Click „New“ and provide path to driver (for example if driver is in folder „C:\Projects\Alza\Python_selenium\Config\chromedriver.exe”, then in „Path“ shall be „C:\Projects\Alza\Python_selenium\Config”).
- Close all the dialog windows by clicking „OK“ button.
- NOTE: If webdriver is added to „Path“ when PyCharm is running, then PyCharm has to be closed and run again in order for the change to take effect.
```

## PyCharm installation
