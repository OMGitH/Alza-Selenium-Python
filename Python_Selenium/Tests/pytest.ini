; For mixed assertions that use soft assertions from pytest_check:
; Following 2 lines configure pytest to start with flag "--check-max-tb=1000". This sets number of failed assertions per test with displayed
; pseudo-traceback (containing clickable link to line with failed assertion) to 1000, default is 1. It effectively means that pseudo-traceback
; will be displayed for every failed assertion.
