; Configuration of pytest to start with flags --check-max-tb=1000 and --capture=no:
; Flag --check-max-tb=1000 is for mixed assertions that use soft assertions from pytest_check. This sets number of failed assertions per test with displayed
; pseudo-traceback (containing clickable link to line with failed assertion) to 1000, default is 1. As a matter of fact it means that pseudo-traceback
; will be displayed for every failed assertion.
; Flag --capture=no is used for pytest html report not to contain stdout or stderr records but only log calls.
